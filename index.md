**Tanish's First CS193 Homework**

Hi, I’m Tanish — an aspiring tech innovator and a part of the Purdue Class of 2029. 

I’m passionate about exploring how technology can shape the future, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I’m curious about how systems work, from smart software to secure networks. 

In fact, I especially love learning about automotive innovation, especially through the World Endurance Championship (WEC) and Formula 1 (F1).

Feel free to reach out; I’m always open to conversations and opportunities!


Here are my favorite things about CS193:
- It provides valuable skills for higher-level courses
- The TAs are laid back and easy to follow
- Resources are posted promptly
